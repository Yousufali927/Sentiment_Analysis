## 1. Project Motivation
A simple Sentiment Analysis using RandomForestClassifier to appreciate the impact of Neural Networks.
In deep learning we can just use Simple neural networks and recurrent neural networks or even just finetune pre-trained models to get incredible accuracies, but even a well-tuned ML algorithm can mostly get around 85% accuracy. 
The ipynb file contains code for a Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using RandomForestClassifier.

## 2. Project Structure
1. Data Collection - dataset form kaggle
2. Data preprocessing - data cleaning
3. feature extraction - converting the reviews into vectors
4. model building - using the RandomForestClassifer from sklearn
5. training and prediction - training the model and making predictions

## 3. Installation
 present within the notebook, 
 Dataset (Starter: Movie Review Dataset b0c5dbc5-c) can be downloaded from here - https://www.kaggle.com/code/kerneler/starter-movie-review-dataset-b0c5dbc5-c 
 

## 4. Usage
You're probably better off without this classifierðŸ™‚, Use a pre-trained LLM and finetune it for much much better results. This is just something I did to really understand the intricacies and differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning, if u say dl is ml then, maybe just to see how much better neural networks really are.
